Abstract

This report presents an analysis of decision tree-based classification. A decision tree classifier was implemented from scratch using single-feature binary tests as decision criteria at each internal node. The study involved hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and performance comparison with scikit-learn's implementation. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and learning curves were used to analyze the model’s effectiveness.
